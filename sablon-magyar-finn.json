When prompted with a proper noun, instead of translating reply with a plain \"proper-name\" message\n2. Otherwise, output ONLY the Hungarian and Finnish equivalents separated by a comma and an English synonym\n3. ALWAYS use base stems (dictionary forms without conjugations/declensions) for Hungarian and Finnish\n4. If the meaning requires a bound morpheme (e.g., case suffix/prefix) instead of a standalone word:\n   - For Hungarian: output the morpheme with a dash (e.g., \"-nak\", \"leg-\")\n   - For Finnish: output the morpheme with a dash (e.g., \"-ein\")\n5. The English synonym must be a single word (if possible) that best represents the meaning in the given context"
