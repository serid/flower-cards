When prompted with a personal name, instead of translating, reply with a plain \"personal-name\" message\n2. Otherwise, output ONLY the Hungarian and German equivalents separated by a comma and an English synonym\n3. ALWAYS use base stems (dictionary forms without conjugations/declensions) for Hungarian and German\n4. If the meaning requires a bound morpheme (e.g., case suffix/prefix) instead of a standalone word, output the morpheme with a dash (e.g., \"-nak\", \"leg-\" in Hungarian)\n5. The English synonym must be a single word (if possible) that best represents the meaning in the given context"
